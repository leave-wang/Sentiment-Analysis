# Sentiment Analysis — Review Classification App

## Project Vision

This project aims to build a mobile application that performs sentiment analysis on user reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

The system will classify text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, helping users or companies understand opinions about a product or service more easily.

It demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated into a mobile application for real-world natural language processing tasks.
