# Sentiment Analysis

## Project Vision
This project aims to develop a **mobile application** that performs sentiment analysis on user reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.  
The app will classify text inputs as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**, helping users or companies quickly understand public opinion about a product or service.

## Title and Brief Description
**Title:** Sentiment Analysis  
**Brief Description:**  
An AI-powered sentiment analysis system implemented as a mobile app.  
It uses NLP and ML models to process user text and predict the emotional tone of the content.  
The system includes both backend model training (Python) and a mobile frontend interface (Java/Flutter).

---

## Platform
- **Programming Languages:** Python (for model) and Java / Flutter (for mobile app)  
- **Backend Framework:** Flask / FastAPI  
- **Frontend Framework:** Flutter or Android Studio  
- **Tools:** GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Dataset
The model will be trained using public datasets of product or movie reviews, such as:
- [Amazon Product Review Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
- [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- Each record includes a text review and its sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral).

---

## Methods
- **Text Preprocessing:** tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, or fine-tuned BERT  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
