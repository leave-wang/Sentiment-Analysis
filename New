# Entity-Aware Sentiment Analysis with Negative Sentiment Smoothing

## Project Vision

This project investigates whether entity-aware sentiment smoothing can improve classification reliability compared to standard baseline models.

The system integrates:

- Machine Learning (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Rule-based Sentiment (Vader)
- Negative Sentiment Smoothing Mechanism (NSSM)
- Mobile deployment via FastAPI + Flutter

Unlike a simple sentiment classifier, this project evaluates whether unrelated negative signals can be reduced to improve model robustness.

## Research Question

Does applying a Negative Sentiment Smoothing mechanism improve sentiment classification performance compared to standard baseline approaches?

Sub-questions:

- Does smoothing reduce false negatives?
- How sensitive is performance to the smoothing parameter β?
- Does entity filtering improve reliability?

## Dataset

Primary Dataset:
- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset (Binary Classification)

Each review includes:
- Text
- Sentiment label (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive)

Dataset is split into:
- Train
- Validation
- Test

## Methodology

### 1. Baseline Models

- Vader (rule-based baseline)
- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Optional: TF-IDF + SVM

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### 2. Negative Sentiment Smoothing (NSSM)

The NSSM module adjusts the sentiment score when unrelated negative sentences are detected.

Steps:

1. Sentence segmentation using spaCy.
2. Identify negative sentences using Vader compound score.
3. Detect whether the sentence contains the target entity.
4. Count unrelated negative sentences.
5. Adjust sentiment score:

S_adjusted = S_0 + β * n

Where:
- S_0 = original compound sentiment score
- n = number of unrelated negative sentences
- β = smoothing parameter

### 3. Experimental Design

Experiments include:

- Baseline vs NSSM comparison
- Beta parameter sweep (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
- Error case analysis
- Ablation study (with vs without entity filtering)
